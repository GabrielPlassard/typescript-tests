# Installation
Run ```npm install```

# Running
Run ```npm run test``` or ```npm run test --silent``` to just have the mocha output without the npm messages when the tests fail.

# Running with watch
Run ```npm run test:watch``` or ```npm run test:mocha:watch``` if your IDE already compiles the typescript files on save.
